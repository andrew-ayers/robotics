### What can be found here? ###

Well, initially not a whole lot, but in time I will fill this repo with stuff I've worked on, am working on, or plan to work on - and probably stuff I've found or collected over the years that may be of interest to others:

* My early robotics experiments and projects
* Stuff I'm doing or planning to do
* Info and such about collectible robots I own
* Code and schematics related to all of the above
